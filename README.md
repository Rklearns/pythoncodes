# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts the quality of wine based on physicochemical tests using a **Random Forest Classifier**. It achieves **~95% test accuracy** after applying **hyperparameter tuning** with `GridSearchCV`. The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit**, offering an interactive and user-friendly interface.
